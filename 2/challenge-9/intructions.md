# Challenge 9 — Find all functions with “command” as part of its name

In an earlier challenge, you wrote a query for function calls. Refine that query further to report all functions which have “command” as part of its name (hint: you can use a predicates that allows you to write regexes).

1. Try to write it first line-by-line
2. Then transform it a predicate instead
3. At last, try to make it into a new class
