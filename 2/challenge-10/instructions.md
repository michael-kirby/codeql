# Challenge 10 — Query the AST

Access the code in a CodeQL database of your choice using “Query the AST” option.

1. Go to the “Explorer” tab in VS Code, which should contain the source archive for the CodeQL database you have added earlier. It should be in one of the bottom folders.
2. Go into the file and code line that interests you. Right click on that line and choose “CodeQL: View AST”. This will show you the AST of the file in the “AST Viewer” in the CodeQL tab.
3. Click on any line and see the AST expand to the node that represents that line of code.
