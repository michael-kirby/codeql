# Challenge 2 â€” find potential sources and sinks in a different vulnerability
Find out what are the potential sources and sinks in a language of your choice for another vulnerability. For inspiration, look into the [Common Weakness Enumeration Database Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2022/2022_cwe_top25.html) or other vulnerabilities in the CWE database.

Hint: if you are having trouble identifying the sources and sinks for a given vulnerability, check out the CodeQL query with that CWE number in [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/full-cwe/). Most queries in the documentation contain examples of vulnerable code snippets, which will make it easy to identify sources and sinks.
