# Challenge 3 - analyze one of the latest injection vulnerabilities
New vulnerabilities are reported every day. Think about the latest injection vulnerability in an opensource project that you have heard about.

3.1 What were the sources and the sinks for that vulnerability?

3.2 Look into the repository of the project. Can you find the source and follow the flow to the sink?

Hint: find the advisory related to the vulnerability. It should contain information about in which version the vulnerability was patched. If the source code is hosted on GitHub, you can easily compare the vulnerable and the patched versions, using the [“compare” feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/comparing-releases).
