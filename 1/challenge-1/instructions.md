# Challenge 1 — find potential sources and sinks in a web application
Choose an open source project in a language of your choice, preferably a web application. Find out what are the potential sources and sinks in a language of your choice for a vulnerability such as SQL injection.

1.1 You have already heard that a potential source could be a parameter from an HTTP GET request. What framework does the project of your choice use? If you have chosen a project that is not a web app,what could the sources be in the project?

1.2 What does an HTTP request look like in that framework? Try to find it in the project.

1.3 What are the sinks for SQL injection?

1.4 What would the sink look like in the project? Try to find it.

1.5 Do any of the sources flow into a sink?

Hint: if you can’t find a project, utilize GitHub search functionality, for example, type in the GitHub search bar [“language:python stars:>100 type:repositories”](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Apython++stars%3A%3E100+type%3Arepositories&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc). You could also choose one of the intentionally vulnerable projects from OWASP DVWA wherein we have an open source repository.
